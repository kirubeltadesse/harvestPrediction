Hi my name is Kirubel. I am a Master student at Purdue University.
I found you contact information on VEDP(Virgina Economic Development Partership). I am currently working on my Master's
thesis on prediction modeling for annual growth cycle of grapevines. (Bud break, Flowering, Fruit set, Varaison, and Harvest stage)

I was wondering if you can provide me with some dataset that includes the recorded dates from those different stages. 


---------------------------------------------------------------
If I receive the data from you I will be giving credit on my work. And mention the source of the data.
